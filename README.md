# What even is this?

Okay, in here we have a simple angular app that allows for the upload, and retrieval of censored classified documents. It was modified from the sample project provided
by Bhargav Bachina as part of this small tutorial. https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-develop-and-build-angular-app-with-nodejs-e24c40444421
I did this to get something up and running to use as a base.

What is also here is a .Net Core webapi I built to showcase how I would put put together the application serving the api. This seemed like a better use of my finite time, as do know yet know how I would apply analogous patterns in node js.

Note: the .net core webapi is not quite done. I intend to integrate it with my angular app this weekend.
